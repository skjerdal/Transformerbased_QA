# Implementation Summary

Here's a summary of the changes made to replace custom components with existing libraries:

## Components Changed:

1. **MultiHeadSelfAttention** ✅
   - Replaced custom attention implementation with TensorFlow's built-in `layers.MultiHeadAttention`
   - Benefits: More efficient, better optimized, less code to maintain

2. **PositionalEncoding** ✅ (Reverted)
   - Reverted back to custom sine/cosine implementation due to TF 2.10.1 compatibility issues with `tensorflow-addons`.
   - Benefits: Maintains compatibility with the required TF version.

3. **Learning Rate Schedule** ✅
   - Replaced custom `WarmupThenDecaySchedule` with TensorFlow's built-in schedulers
   - Benefits: Simpler code, well-tested implementation

4. **Weights & Biases Integration** ✅
   - Enhanced with Hugging Face's built-in W&B callback
   - Benefits: More features, automatic logging, improved visualization

5. **Evaluation Metrics** ✅
   - Replaced custom EM/F1 calculation with Hugging Face's SQuAD metrics
   - Benefits: Standard implementation, fewer bugs, easier to benchmark

6. **Data Pipeline** ✅
   - Replaced custom SQuAD preprocessing with Hugging Face Datasets
   - Benefits: Better token-to-char mapping, built-in validation split, cleaner code

## Core Parts Preserved:

1. **TransformerBlock Architecture**
   - Kept custom implementation for maximum flexibility
   - Enhanced internal components without changing overall structure

2. **QA Model Structure**
   - Maintained the same dual-output (start/end logits) architecture

## Installation Requirements:

```bash
pip install tensorflow==2.10.1 transformers datasets evaluate wandb
```

## Usage:

The updated code can be run with the same command as before:
```bash
python train_squad.py
```

The changes are transparent to the end user while providing significant internal improvements.
